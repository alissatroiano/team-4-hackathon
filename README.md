# CovidXmas Calendar
+ We offer a personalized xmasy calendar with the theme of Happy Holidays with coXmas touch! This was built by team THE CALENDERERS for the Code Institute December 2021 Hackathon.
It was built to reflect the merry season spirit to our audience, with a simple but effective design that consists of animated combination on each day of December, 
specifically picked to inspire and uplift the user after COVID-19, global restrictions and two years of hardship.
